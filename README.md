## A description of the project
This app will provide information users can use to research and inform their voting options. It will also help them get set up to vote if they are not already registered. It will also provide information about the politicians who represent them in their districts and how they have voted in the past.

## The overall problem domain and how the project solves those problems
Voter engagement is relatively low currently. One of the reasons for this is because of insufficient information leading to voter apathy. This app is designed to make it super easy for someone to find out who represents them and how they have voted in the past.
